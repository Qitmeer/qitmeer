### How to Run

Memory Requirements
  * Minimum: 1GB
  * Recommended: 2GB

Make sure to have at least 1GB free memory to run qitmeer. Insufficient memory
may lead to the process being killed unexpectedly when its running.
See [FAQ #3](#Qitmeer-is-killed-unexpectedly) for details.

#### Getting Started 

##### Mainnet
The easiest way to connect to mainnet is run `qitmeer` directly without any argument by executing following command.
```
./qitmeer
```

you will see following information from the console when the `qitmeer` node is started successfully. 

```

         .__  __
    _____|__|/  |_  _____   ____   ___________    Qitmeer 0.10.6-release-xxxx
   / ____/  \   __\/     \_/ __ \_/ __ \_  __ \   Port: <your_port, 8130 by defaut>

```


Several configuration options available to tweak how it runs. Please see details by
using the `help` command
```
./qitmeer --help
```

##### Testnet
Please make sure use `--testnet` to connect to the test network.
```
./qitmeer --testnet
```

#### Running with Docker

## FAQ

### How to exit qitmeer properly.

You can use `Ctrl+C` to exit in the foreground, or `kill` or `kill -2` if in the backgroud.
Please don't use `kill -9` to kill the `qitmeer` process , this terminates the process abruptly
and may leave database files improperly closed. may result corrupt data files.
In the worst case, you might need to do a refresh block synchronization.

### How to clean up corrupt data
```
qitmeer --cleanup --testnet
```
***Please be careful! the command results your data to be removed!***


### How to fix `golang.org unrecognized` Issue

If you got trouble to download the `golang.org` depends automatically

```
go: golang.org/x/crypto@v0.0.0-20181001203147-e3636079e1a4: unrecognized import path "golang.org/x/crypto" (https fetch: Get https://golang.org/x/crypto?go-get=1: dial tcp 216.239.37.1:443: i/o timeout)
go: golang.org/x/net@v0.0.0-20181005035420-146acd28ed58: unrecognized import path "golang.org/x/net" (https fetch: Get https://golang.org/x/net?go-get=1: dial tcp 216.239.37.1:443: i/o timeout)
go: golang.org/x/net@v0.0.0-20180906233101-161cd47e91fd: unrecognized import path "golang.org/x/net" (https fetch: Get https://golang.org/x/net?go-get=1: dial tcp 216.239.37.1:443: i/o timeout)
```

you might need to `replace` the download url (ex: using a mirror site like github.com) on your `go.mod`

```
replace (
	golang.org/x/crypto v0.0.0-20181001203147-e3636079e1a4 => github.com/golang/crypto v0.0.0-20181001203147-e3636079e1a4
	golang.org/x/net v0.0.0-20180906233101-161cd47e91fd => github.com/golang/net v0.0.0-20180906233101-161cd47e91fd
	golang.org/x/net v0.0.0-20181005035420-146acd28ed58 => github.com/golang/net v0.0.0-20181005035420-146acd28ed58
)
```

### Qitmeer is killed unexpectedly

`qitmeer` is killed unexpectedly probably due to the `Out of Memory`, If you're using `Ubuntu` linux,
you can verify it by following command.
```sh
dmesg -T| grep -E -i -B100 'killed process'
```
If you find similar output as follows, then that maybe the case
```sh
[Tue Mar  9 11:34:26 2021] Out of memory: Killed process 140587 (qitmeer) total-vm:1403144kB,
anon-rss:675828kB, file-rss:0kB, shmem-rss:0kB, UID:1001 pgtables:1532kB oom_score_adj:0
```
The minimum memory requirement is 1GB, and we strongly recommend upgrading the memory to 2GB.

If the memory resource restrictions is do your case, You might try to upgrade your `Golang` to the latest version
and re-compile `Qitmeer` and try yourself. We have received feedbacks from community that the
newly golang compiler have better memory optimizations, might work better wth low memory
requirement, and especially for `Ubuntu 20.04`.

If you're using `Ubuntu 18.04/20.04`, then you can use the `longsleep/golang-backports` PPA
and update to latest `golang`. then re-compile your qitmeer and try if works for you.
```sh
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:longsleep/golang-backports
sudo apt update
sudo apt install golang-go
```
Please note, it does not guarantee that compiling with the latest `golang` might work.
Adding more computer memory is always the recommended way.

### Compliing failed by missing the `go.sum` entries

If your `golang` version is **1.16 or above**, you might see similar error as follows when compiling.

```shell
go: github.com/Qitmeer/crypto@v0.0.0-20200516043559-dd457edff06c: missing go.sum entry; to add it:
        go mod download github.com/Qitmeer/crypto
make: *** [Makefile:41: qitmeer-build] Error 1
```
It's due to `go1.16` changes default mod rules by disabling auto fixing missing entry in `go.sum` file.
see [details here](https://blog.golang.org/go116-module-changes).

It's an known issue and fixed by the latest code, Please update `Qitmeer` to the latest version
and do the compiling again.

If you somehow need to stick to the current version, please make sure to execute following command before you compile qitmeer:
```shell
go mod tidy
```
