# See http://help.github.com/ignore-files/ for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
.DS_Store
# used by the Makefile

# travis

# IdeaIDE
.idea

# Folders
vendor
bin

# Binaries
qitmeer
qitmeer.exe
*.zip

# Go
go.sum
